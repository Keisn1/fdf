*** I'm using minilibX in a C-project. Inside minilibX (include <mlx.h>), there is a function:
#+begin_src c
int mlx_pixel_put ( void *mlx_ptr, void *win_ptr, int x, int y, int color );
#+end_src
In my project, I use this function, i.e. in the following way:
#+begin_src c
void draw_rect_win(void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int p1, int p2) {
	int x = p1;
	int y = p2;
	while (x < 100) {
		y = p2;
		while (y < 200)
			mlx_pixel_put(mlx_ptr, win_ptr, x, y++, #FF00FF);
		x++;
	}
}
#+end_src
Using googletest, I want to test that the function draw_rect_win calls mlx_pixel_put with the right parameters and the right amount of times. How do I do that?

To test the =draw_rect_win= function and verify that it calls =mlx_pixel_put= with the correct parameters and the correct number of times, you can use a technique called "mocking". Mocking allows you to replace a function with a mock version that records the calls made to it, allowing you to verify parameters and call counts.

Since you're using =googletest=, you can also pair it with =gmock= for mocking purposes. Here's a simplified approach:

1. *Create a Mock Class:*

   You'll need to create a mock class that mimics the behavior of =mlx_pixel_put=. Because =gmock= can't directly mock functions (only methods), you can wrap =mlx_pixel_put= in a class.

2. *Write Your Test:*

   Use =gmock= to set expectations regarding the calls to =mlx_pixel_put=.

Here is a brief example:

#+begin_src cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

// Mock class that wraps mlx_pixel_put
class MLXWrapper {
public:
    MOCK_METHOD5(pixelPut, int(void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int x, int y, int color));
};

// Global or static instance for the test
MLXWrapper* g_mlxWrapper = nullptr;

// Replace with the mocked version
extern "C" int mlx_pixel_put(void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int x, int y, int color) {
    if (g_mlxWrapper) {
        return g_mlxWrapper->pixelPut(mlx_ptr, win_ptr, x, y, color);
    }
    return 0;
}

// Wrap your draw_rect_win call to use g_mlxWrapper
void draw_rect_win(void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int p1, int p2, MLXWrapper& mlxWrapper) {
    g_mlxWrapper = &mlxWrapper;
    int x = p1;
    int y = p2;
    while (x < 100) {
        y = p2;
        while (y < 200) {
            mlx_pixel_put(mlx_ptr, win_ptr, x, y++, 0xFF00FF);
        }
        x++;
    }
    g_mlxWrapper = nullptr;
}

// Example test
TEST(DrawRectWinTest, CallsMlxPixelPutCorrectly) {
    MLXWrapper mock;
    const int start_x = 10;
    const int start_y = 20;

    // Expect mlx_pixel_put to be called 90 * 180 times with specific parameters
    EXPECT_CALL(mock, pixelPut(testing::_, testing::_, testing::Ge(start_x), testing::Lt(100), testing::Lt(200), 0xFF00FF))
        .Times((100 - start_x) * (200 - start_y));

    draw_rect_win(nullptr, nullptr, start_x, start_y, mock);
}
#+end_src

**** Explanation:

1. *Mock Class:* =MLXWrapper= is a class that acts as a mock for =mlx_pixel_put=.

2. *Global Pointer:* =g_mlxWrapper= holds the mock object during the test.

3. *Mocking =mlx_pixel_put=:* The C function =mlx_pixel_put= is redirected to call =MLXWrapper::pixelPut=, allowing us to intercept calls to =mlx_pixel_put=.

4. *Setting Expectations:* =EXPECT_CALL= is used to set expectations on the parameters and the number of calls.

5. *Testing:* We use these expectations to verify the behavior of =draw_rect_win=.

This mock setup can be adjusted based on your testing needs. You may need to adapt the =draw_rect_win= function to handle the new mock environment, such as by passing in the =MLXWrapper= object or using a different interface abstraction in production code.

*** So In my test, I would need to hold a copy (the wrapper) of my draw_rect_win?

Yes, in your test, you'll need to create a mock class that wraps the functionality of =mlx_pixel_put= to intercept calls and verify that =draw_rect_win= interacts with it correctly. Here's how you can structure it:

1. *Mock the =mlx_pixel_put=:* Create a mock class where the =mlx_pixel_put= function is represented as a method. This mock class will record how many times the method is called and with what parameters.

2. *Modify or Wrap =draw_rect_win=:* Ensure that =draw_rect_win= can be tested by either directly using the mock class or by passing a pointer/reference to the mock object.

Here's a streamlined approach:

**** Mock Class

Create a class that contains a mock method for =mlx_pixel_put=.

#+begin_src cpp
class MLXWrapper {
public:
    MOCK_METHOD5(pixelPut, int(void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int x, int y, int color));
};
#+end_src

**** Modify =draw_rect_win= for Testing

You can modify =draw_rect_win= to use the mock object explicitly for testing. One simple way is to change =draw_rect_win= to take a function pointer or a functor (like a lambda or a =std::function=). This allows you to inject the mock behavior.

#+begin_src cpp
typedef int (*PixelPutFunc)(void*, void*, int, int, int);

void draw_rect_win(void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int p1, int p2, PixelPutFunc pixel_put) {
    int x = p1;
    int y = p2;
    while (x < 100) {
        y = p2;
        while (y < 200) {
            pixel_put(mlx_ptr, win_ptr, x, y++, 0xFF00FF);
        }
        x++;
    }
}
#+end_src

**** Testing with Googletest and Google Mock

Set up your test to use the mock object and validate the calls.

#+begin_src cpp
TEST(DrawRectWinTest, CallsMlxPixelPutCorrectly) {
    MLXWrapper mock;
    const int start_x = 10;
    const int start_y = 20;

    // Expect the mock's pixelPut to be called the right number of times
    EXPECT_CALL(mock, pixelPut(testing::_, testing::_, testing::Ge(start_x), testing::Lt(100), testing::Lt(200), 0xFF00FF))
        .Times((100 - start_x) * (200 - start_y));

    auto mock_pixel_put = [&](void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int x, int y, int color) {
        return mock.pixelPut(mlx_ptr, win_ptr, x, y, color);
    };

    draw_rect_win(nullptr, nullptr, start_x, start_y, mock_pixel_put);
}
#+end_src

**** Explanation

- *Mocking:* The =MLXWrapper= mock class uses =MOCK_METHOD= to allow =gmock= to track calls to =mlx_pixel_put=.
- *Injection:* Use a lambda to wrap the call to the mock method, passing it as a parameter to =draw_rect_win=.
- *Testing Framework:* The =EXPECT_CALL= macro from =gmock= verifies that the function calls happen as expected with =testing::Ge= and =testing::Lt= ensuring proper bounds for calls.

This setup allows you to test that =draw_rect_win= calls =mlx_pixel_put= correctly without modifying the core logic or relying on the actual implementation in your production code.

*** For the first example, that you have given me: the compiler complains at line:
#+begin_src c
EXPECT_CALL(mock, pixelPut(testing::_, testing::_, testing::Ge(start_x), testing::Lt(100), testing::Lt(200), 0xFF00FF))
        .Times((100 - start_x) * (200 - start_y));
#+end_src
with: "tests/test_bresenham.cpp:42:31: error: no matching function for call to ‘MLXWrapper::gmock_pixelPut(const testing::internal::AnythingMatcher&, const testing::internal::AnythingMatcher&, testing::internal::GeMatcher<int>, testing::internal::LtMatcher<int>, testing::internal::LtMatcher<int>, int)’"


The error indicates that the signature of the mock method setup using =EXPECT_CALL= doesn't match the expected parameters in the mock class. The =EXPECT_CALL= line is expecting a specific set of arguments, which might not be matching what was defined in your mock method.

To resolve this issue, make sure the mock method signature in your mock class is defined correctly. In your =MLXWrapper=, make sure the =MOCK_METHOD= line includes all five parameters in the correct order. Here is how it should approximately look:

#+begin_src cpp
class MLXWrapper {
public:
    // Define pixelPut with 5 parameters: two void pointers and three integers.
    MOCK_METHOD5(pixelPut, int(void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int x, int y, int color));
};
#+end_src

Additionally, double-check that the order and types of the arguments in the =EXPECT_CALL= line match this signature:

#+begin_src cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, pixelPut(testing::_, testing::_, testing::Ge(start_x), testing::Lt(100), testing::Lt(200), 0xFF00FF))
    .Times((100 - start_x) * (200 - start_y));
#+end_src

Here are a few points to verify:

- *Placeholders*: Make sure the placeholders like =testing::_= match the expected types for the mocked method. If using =testing::Ge= and =testing::Lt=, ensure they match the correct =int= arguments.
- *Argument Order*: Arguments in =EXPECT_CALL= must match the order and types defined in the =MOCK_METHOD= macro.
- *Correct Matcher Use*: Ensure the matchers like =testing::Ge= and =testing::Lt= are applied to =int= types and that you're using them for the correct arguments.

If all these parts match properly, the error should resolve. If the issue persists, verify any additional error messages for more guidance.

*** what linkage flags do I need to use?

When using Google Test and Google Mock, you'll typically need to link against those libraries. The necessary linkage flags depend on how you installed these libraries. Here’s a general guideline:

1. *Google Test and Google Mock Libraries*: You need to link against the compiled Google Test and Google Mock libraries. Typically, these are named =libgtest.a= and =libgmock.a= (or similar, depending on your setup).

2. *Thread Library*: Google Test requires the threading library (=-pthread=) since many implementations are multi-threaded.

Assuming you're using typical naming and a directory structure, your linkage flags might look like this:

#+begin_src bash
-lgtest -lgmock -pthread
#+end_src

If you installed Google Test and Google Mock from a package manager (like apt on Ubuntu), the following command should work if the libraries are installed in standard locations:

#+begin_src bash
g++ -o my_test my_test.cpp -lgtest -lgmock -pthread
#+end_src

If you compiled Google Test and Google Mock from source and they are in a non-standard directory, you may also need to specify the library path:

#+begin_src bash
g++ -o my_test my_test.cpp -L/path/to/gtest/lib -L/path/to/gmock/lib -lgtest -lgmock -pthread
#+end_src

Replace =/path/to/gtest/lib= and =/path/to/gmock/lib= with the actual paths where the libraries are located.

Lastly, ensure that the header files for Google Test and Google Mock are in the include path. You can add them with the =-I= flag if they are not in standard locations:

#+begin_src bash
g++ -o my_test my_test.cpp -I/path/to/gtest/include -I/path/to/gmock/include -L/path/to/gtest/lib -L/path/to/gmock/lib -lgtest -lgmock -pthread
#+end_src

Adjust these commands based on your specific installation paths and system environment.

*** is it possible, to indicate a range of values for the parameters? For example, in my example, i would like it to be called with ints from 0 to 100

Yes, you can specify a range of values for the parameters using Google Mock's matchers. =testing::Between= is particularly useful for specifying a range. Here's how you can use it in your test:

#+begin_src cpp
EXPECT_CALL(mock, pixelPut(testing::_, testing::_, testing::AllOf(testing::Ge(0), testing::Le(100)),
                           testing::AllOf(testing::Ge(0), testing::Le(200)), 0xFF00FF))
    .Times((100 - start_x) * (200 - start_y));
#+end_src

**** Explanation:

- *=testing::AllOf=*: This matcher combines multiple conditions. Here, it's used to ensure that the values lie within a specific range.
- *=testing::Ge= and =testing::Le=*: These matchers check if a value is greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to the specified bounds.
- *=Times=*: Specifies how many times you expect the function to be called with the given conditions.

This setup ensures that the =pixelPut= function is called with =x= values in the range [0, 100] and =y= values in the range [0, 200]. Adjust the actual numbers based on your specific requirements and test logic.

*** ok, but it doesn't assert that the function has been called with any value in that range

In Google Mock, when you use the =EXPECT_CALL= with a matcher like =testing::AllOf= combined with =testing::Ge= and =testing::Le=, it sets up an expectation that the mock function is called with values that fall within that specified range. However, it doesn't guarantee that all values within that range were used—it only checks if the function was called with parameters within that specified range.

If you want to assert that the function is called for every single value in a range (e.g., all integers from 0 to 100), you'll need to set up expectations accordingly and ensure that your test logic calls the function for each value within that range. Unfortunately, =gmock= doesn't directly support checking every single value in a range explicitly in one go—you'd need to handle this through your test.

Here's a strategy to ensure coverage over a range:

1. /Modify Your Test Logic:* Make sure your test setup itself ensures that each value will invoke the call.
2. /Count Calls:* Use =EXPECT_CALL= with =.Times()= to check the exact number of expected invocations.

Here's a refined approach to ensure every value in a range gets called:

#+begin_src cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MLXWrapper {
public:
    MOCK_METHOD5(pixelPut, int(void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int x, int y, int color));
};

TEST(DrawRectWinTest, CallsMlxPixelPutForEachValueInRange) {
    MLXWrapper mock;
    const int start_x = 0;
    const int end_x = 100;
    const int start_y = 0;
    const int end_y = 200;

    // Set up expectation for every (x, y) pair in the desired range
    for (int x = start_x; x < end_x; ++x) {
        for (int y = start_y; y < end_y; ++y) {
            EXPECT_CALL(mock, pixelPut(::testing::_, ::testing::_, x, y, 0xFF00FF)).Times(1);
        }
    }

    // Call the function to be tested
    draw_rect_win(nullptr, nullptr, start_x, start_y, [&](void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int x, int y, int color) {
        return mock.pixelPut(mlx_ptr, win_ptr, x, y, color);
    });
}
#+end_src

In this example:

- *Loop through the Range:* You loop over each expected value and set an =EXPECT_CALL= for that specific =(x, y)= coordinate.
- *Use Lambda for Mock Call:* Use a lambda or function to pass to =draw_rect_win=, which uses the mock's method.

This effectively ensures that each expected coordinate invokes the function exactly once, meeting your requirement to "assert that the function has been called with any value in that range."

***
*** in the second example, that you have given me, you are using a lambda, and give it as parameter to draw_rect_win. Since draw_rect_win is a C function, this does not confirm with the PixelPutFunc type

You're right, passing a lambda function to a C-style function expecting a regular function pointer isn't directly possible since lambdas with captures or C++ function objects (=std::function=) aren't compatible with C function pointer types. Here's how to handle this:

1. *Use a C Function*: Define a static or standalone C function that calls the mock method.

2. *Global or Static Mock Object*: Use a global or static mock object that this C function can reference to call =pixelPut=.

Here's how you could adjust the example to work with C-style function pointers:

#+begin_src cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MLXWrapper {
public:
    MOCK_METHOD5(pixelPut, int(void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int x, int y, int color));
};

// Global pointer to use in the C function
static MLXWrapper* g_mockWrapper = nullptr;

// C-style function matching the PixelPutFunc signature
extern "C" int mock_pixel_put(void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int x, int y, int color) {
    if (g_mockWrapper) {
        return g_mockWrapper->pixelPut(mlx_ptr, win_ptr, x, y, color);
    }
    return 0;
}

typedef int (*PixelPutFunc)(void*, void*, int, int, int);

// Adjust this function if needed to use the function pointer
void draw_rect_win(void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int p1, int p2, PixelPutFunc pixel_put) {
    int x = p1;
    int y = p2;
    while (x < 100) {
        y = p2;
        while (y < 200) {
            pixel_put(mlx_ptr, win_ptr, x, y++, 0xFF00FF);
        }
        x++;
    }
}

TEST(DrawRectWinTest, CallsMlxPixelPutForEachValueInRange) {
    MLXWrapper mock;
    g_mockWrapper = &mock;

    const int start_x = 10;
    const int end_x = 100;
    const int start_y = 20;
    const int end_y = 200;

    // Set up expectation for the function calls
    EXPECT_CALL(mock, pixelPut(testing::_, testing::_, testing::Ge(start_x), testing::Lt(end_x),
                               testing::Ge(start_y), testing::Lt(end_y), 0xFF00FF))
        .Times((end_x - start_x) * (end_y - start_y));

    draw_rect_win(nullptr, nullptr, start_x, start_y, mock_pixel_put);

    g_mockWrapper = nullptr; // Clean up
}
#+end_src

**** Key Points:

- *C-Style Callback*: The =mock_pixel_put= function acts as a bridge between your C function and the C++ mock object.
- *Global Mock Object*: The =g_mockWrapper= serves as a global accessor to the mock, allowing the standalone C function to use it.
- *Expectations*: Ensure the =EXPECT_CALL= setup correctly expects the range and exact number of calls needed for your test. Adjust the conditions to meet your specific test purposes.

***
*** how do i test that a function was testet a certain amount of times, no matter the arguments?


To test that a function is called a specific number of times, regardless of the arguments, you can set up your expectation with =testing::_= as a wildcard to ignore all arguments. Use =.Times(n)= to specify the exact number of times the function should be called. Here's how you can do that with Google Mock:

#+begin_src cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>

class MLXWrapper {
public:
    MOCK_METHOD5(pixelPut, int(void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int x, int y, int color));
};

TEST(DrawRectWinTest, CallsMlxPixelPutExactNumberOfTimes) {
    MLXWrapper mock;
    g_mockWrapper = &mock;

    // Assume this is based on the logic in draw_rect_win for a given p1 and p2
    const int expectedCalls = 90 * 180; // Adjust this based on your actual logic

    EXPECT_CALL(mock, pixelPut(testing::_, testing::_, testing::_, testing::_, testing::_))
        .Times(expectedCalls);

    draw_rect_win(nullptr, nullptr, 10, 20, mock_pixel_put);

    g_mockWrapper = nullptr; // Clean up
}
#+end_src

*** Explanation:

- *=EXPECT_CALL= with =testing::_=:* The =testing::_= matcher acts as a wildcard, indicating "match any value" for each parameter of =pixelPut=, allowing us to ignore specific arguments.

- *=.Times(n)=:* This specifies that the mock function should be called =n= times in total. Adjust =expectedCalls= to reflect the number of expected invocations based on your function's logic.

- *Global/Static Mock Usage:* Ensure the =mock_pixel_put= bridges to the mock object correctly if you're handling this in a C-style callback environment.

This setup verifies the function call count without consideration for the actual arguments used in each call.

*** how can i know at which value-combination the expected call didn't appear?

To diagnose at which value-combination the expected call didn't appear, you can enhance your test output by logging the actual call parameters. This can help you figure out which particular calls were missing. One way to accomplish this is by using Google Mock's "action" and "side effect" features to record parameters or print them out each time the mock method is called.

Here's an approach using a custom action to log the parameters:

#+begin_src cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include <gmock/gmock.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <set>

class MLXWrapper {
public:
    MOCK_METHOD5(pixelPut, int(void* mlx_ptr, void* win_ptr, int x, int y, int color));
};

// A simple struct to hold the call details for comparison later
struct CallDetails {
    int x;
    int y;
    bool operator<(const CallDetails& other) const {
        return std::tie(x, y) < std::tie(other.x, other.y);
    }
};

TEST(DrawRectWinTest, IdentifyMissingCalls) {
    MLXWrapper mock;
    g_mockWrapper = &mock;

    const int start_x = 10;
    const int end_x = 100;
    const int start_y = 20;
    const int end_y = 200;

    std::set<CallDetails> expectedCalls;
    for (int x = start_x; x < end_x; ++x) {
        for (int y = start_y; y < end_y; ++y) {
            expectedCalls.insert({x, y});
        }
    }

    std::set<CallDetails> actualCalls;

    // Log actual call parameters
    EXPECT_CALL(mock, pixelPut(testing::_, testing::_, testing::_, testing::_, testing::_))
        .WillRepeatedly(testing::Invoke([&actualCalls](void*, void*, int x, int y, int) {
            actualCalls.insert({x, y});
            return 0;
        }));

    draw_rect_win(nullptr, nullptr, start_x, start_y, mock_pixel_put);

    // Compare and log any missing calls
    for (const auto& expected : expectedCalls) {
        if (actualCalls.find(expected) == actualCalls.end()) {
            std::cerr << "Missing call for x: " << expected.x << ", y: " << expected.y << "\n";
        }
    }

    g_mockWrapper = nullptr; // Clean up
}
#+end_src

*** Explanation:

1. *Call Tracking*: Use a =std::set<CallDetails>= to track which =(x, y)= calls you expect and which ones actually occur.

2. *Invoke Action*: The =Invoke= action captures parameters every time =pixelPut= is called and logs them into =actualCalls=.

3. *Comparison*: After =draw_rect_win= runs, compare =expectedCalls= to =actualCalls= and print out any missing calls.

This approach gives you insight into which specific =(x, y)= values weren't called in the way you expected. Adjust the matchers and logic to suit your specific test context.
