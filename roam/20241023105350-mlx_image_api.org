#+title: mlx image api
#+date: [2024-10-23 Wed 10:53]
#+startup: overview

* mlx_new_image
- creates a new image in memory
- It returns a void *identifier needed to manipulate this image later.
- size (width and height), mlx_ptr connection identifier
* mlx_put_image_to_window
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- dump the image inside a specified window to display it on screen
- connection, window and image pointer (mlx_ptr, win_ptr and img_ptr)
- x and y define placement

* mlx_get_data_addr
- allow user to modify image
#+begin_src c
char *mlx_get_data_addr (void *img_ptr, int *bits_per_pixel, int *size_line, int *endian);
#+end_src
- =bits_per_pixel= ~bpp~
  - usually 4 (pixels are basically integers)
    - but can differ (8bit colors on a remote display)
  - (depth of the image)
  - number of bits needed to represent a pixel in color
  - it is an integer, that tells you how many bits per pixel are used
- =size_line=
  - number of bytes used to store one line
- =endian=
  - whether it needs to be stored in little-(0) or big-endian(1)

- beginning of memory area where the image is store
- From this adress, the first =bits_per_pixel bits= represent the color of the first pixel in the first  line of the image.
- The second group of =bits_per_pixel= bits represent the second pixel of the first line, and so on.
- Add =size_line= to the adress to get the begining of the second line
- You can reach any pixels of the image that way.

* mlx_get_color_value
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

* mlx_destroy_image
- destroys the given image ( img_ptr ).

* Reading (XPM) images
- The mlx_xpm_to_image () and mlx_xpm_file_to_image () functions will create  a  new  image the same way.
- They will fill it using the specified xpm_data or filename, depending on which function is used.
- Note that MiniLibX  does not use the standard Xpm library to deal with xpm images.
- You may not be able to read all types of xpm images
- It however handles transparency
