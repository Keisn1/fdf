#+title: keycode vs keysym

In the context of keyboard input in computing, a keycode and a keysym (key symbol) refer to different but related concepts:

1. *Keycode*:
   - A keycode is a hardware-dependent code that represents the position of a key on a keyboard.
   - It is a numeric representation that identifies a specific key on a physical keyboard, regardless of what character or function it may perform.
   - Keycodes are usually generated at a low level by the keyboard hardware or its driver.

2. *Keysym*:
   - A keysym (key symbol) is a higher-level representation that describes the character or function associated with a key press, which can vary based on the keyboard layout or the state of modifier keys (like Shift or Alt).
   - It is hardware-independent and represents the intended input. For instance, pressing the "A" key might generate different keysyms depending on whether the Shift key is pressed (e.g., "a" versus "A").

In summary, a keycode identifies the physical key, while a keysym identifies the symbolic meaning of that key press, often influenced by the current keyboard layout and modifier keys.
