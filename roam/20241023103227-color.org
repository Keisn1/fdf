RGB colors

| 0 | R | G | B | color integer |
|---+---+---+---+---------------|

integer type
RGB values must be set inside the integer to display the right color.

#+begin_src c
int rgb(int red, int green, int blue) {
	int color = red << 16;
	color += (green<<8);
	color += blue;
	return color;
}
#+end_src

using hex-literals
#+begin_src c
mlx_pixel_put( mlx_ptr, win_ptr, count2, count1, 0x00000000)));
#+end_src

* endian problems
- Endian problems refer to inconsistencies in the way data is stored and accessed in computer memory
- While filling the integer, make sure you avoid endian problems
  - Remember that the "blue" byte should always be the least significant one
- This can cause issues when moving data between systems that use different byte order formats, such as big-endian and little-endian.
- Most modern systems, including x86-based processors (such as Intel and AMD), ARM processors, and many others, use the little-endian byte ordering format.
